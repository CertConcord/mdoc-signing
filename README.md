# mdoc Signing Certificates

Issuer-certified document keys and signing purposes carried by mdoc credentials, with distinct issuer authentication, holder authentication and document signatures.

**Draft 01. No stable release or upstream adoption is claimed.**

[Draft](draft.md) defines the technical scope and limits. [Sources](sources.json) pins the upstream documents. [Cases](cases.json) identifies the positive and negative evaluation cases.

This repository can be reviewed and used independently of the CertConcord framework. It does not require the framework's authority hierarchy, operation objects or deployment. The framework selects this work through a pinned dependency and adds its own integration policy.

Run with Node.js 24.15 or later:

    npm run check
    npm test
